# PTC-Interpreter
Interpreter/Emulator for Petit Computer.
Written in Java using Swing.

# How to use
Compile and run the program.

Upon running the program, you can load a .PTC file; the suggested location is in programs folder.
Samples 1-5 are included, as well as some testing programs I created. Support for each program varies, since most of the functions are still a work in progress. As of now, samples 1-5 should work correctly, with the exception of 3 because sounds have not been implemented yet.

# Controls
Note: For text input, just type as you would on a normal keyboard. Not all keys are working (no shift) but alphanumeric keys should all work.
